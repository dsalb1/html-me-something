						<h2>Webster Groves, Missouri</a></h2>
						<p>I was born in St. Louis, Missouri in the spring of 1988. I grew up in Webster Groves, a leafy suburb about 5 miles outside the St. Louis City limits. I spent my childhood roaming nearby Blackburn Park, and playing video games, soccer, basketball and roller hockey. I attended Webster Groves High School, where I lettered in lacross, graduating in 2006.</p>

						<h2>Columbia, Missouri</h2>
						<p>I attended school at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where I majored in Anthropology and History. I had a lot of fun in school and grew a lot as a person, both intellectually and emotionally. It was in college where I picked up running and also where I became interested in social justice. I lived in Columbia for four years as a college student and one as the senior research technician at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.</p>

					<h2>San Ignacio, Belize</h2>
					<p>I spent the summer of 2011 working as a volunteer archaeological survey technician with a University of Alabama research project. The project was led by my future graduate school advisor, Dr. John Blitz, and his wife, Dr. Lisa Lecount. We stayed at a small eco-lodge just down the road from San Ignacio, directly across the river from where we worked.</p>

					<h2>Tuscaloosa, Alabama</h2>
					<p>I attended graduate school at the University of Alabama, where I wrote my Master's thesis on the relationship between nonlocal pottery exchange and the political economy of the ancient Mississippian polity of Moundville. While studying at Alabama I also taught, excavated at Moundville, and was able to travel and learn a lot about the Southeastern United States.</p>

					<h2>Ollantaytambo, Peru</h2>
					<p>The summer after I finished graduate school I traveled to the sacred valley of Peru for an archaeological project led by my former professor, Dr. Steven Kosiba. I spent the summer surveying Inka and pre-Inka sites near Ollantaytambo, Peru, a quaint town built atop Inka ruins that is commonly referred to as the last train stop before Machu Pichu. In Peru I got the chance to visit some amazing sites, including colonial Cuzco and Lima, Pisaq, Sasquehuaman, and, of course, Machu Pichu.</p>

					<h2>St. Louis, Missouri</h2>
					<p>Upon returning to the United States I moved back home to St. Louis. Rather than return to live with my parents, however, I moved to the Tower Grove East Neighborhood in the city proper. Tower Grove East afforded me an amazing vantage point in rediscovering my home town. It was walkable - near a huge park, an ethnically diverse business district, and numerous grocery stores - but also conveniently proximate to downtown St. Louis and other great nightlife areas. When I'm not kicking around the city or at work, you can probably find me at home brushing up on my web development skills. </p>
